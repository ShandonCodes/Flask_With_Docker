# Flask with Docker

#### A Flask is better with Docker

## Overview
A Flask API served in a Docker container as seen in [this](https://youtu.be/j0vqCOb3C8c) video.

## Installation
After cloning the repo simply run the premade run script:

```
$ ./run.sh
```

After running the script, the server will start on port 5000 and will be accessible via localhost or the computer's local IP.

>> NOTE: API route definitions are viewable in the `Server.py` file.
